# AR Slingshot Game

This game was built for a project in Holberton School's AR/VR Specialization curriculum.

## How To Play

- Scan an area with your camera to detect play surfaces.
- Select a play surface and press Start.
- Drag stone toward you and release to fire at the traget bottles.
- The points received for striking a bottle will scale relative to the distance from which you fired.
- Game will end when you're out of stones or all targets have been destroyed.
- Press Reset to play on the same surface again or New to find new play surfaces.
